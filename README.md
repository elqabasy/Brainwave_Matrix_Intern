# Internship Tasks Repository

This repository contains my internship tasks implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The tasks focus on building banking-related systems.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: ATM Interface
- **Description**:  
  A simple ATM interface that simulates basic ATM functionalities.
- **Features**:
  - User authentication with a PIN.
  - Check account balance.
  - Deposit funds.
  - Withdraw funds (with a limit).
  - Exit functionality.
- **OOP Concepts Used**:
  - Encapsulation for secure data handling.
  - Classes and objects for modular design.
  - Functions for specific ATM operations.

### Task 2: Bank System
- **Description**:  
  An online banking system that allows users to manage their accounts.
- **Features**:
  - Create user accounts with unique IDs.
  - Deposit funds into accounts.
  - Withdraw funds from accounts.
  - Transfer money between accounts.
  - View account details.
- **OOP Concepts Used**:
  - Inheritance to extend functionality.
  - Polymorphism for flexible operations.
  - Encapsulation for secure data storage.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Paradigm**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Development Tools**: Any standard C++ IDE or text editor.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired task folder:
   ```bash
   cd task1_atm_interface
   ```
3. Compile and run the code:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o atm && ./atm
   ```

## Project Structure
```plaintext

```

## Future Improvements
- Implement a database or file system for data persistence.
- Enhance user interface with GUI tools.
- Add error handling for invalid inputs.
